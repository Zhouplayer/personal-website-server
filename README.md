# Server Side (Flask)

This is the server-side of my personal website. It is built using **Python Flask** to provide RESTful APIs and handle the backend logic.

## Features

- RESTful API endpoints for dynamic communication with the client-side (React).
- Lightweight and scalable backend using Flask.
- Integration with a database (if applicable).
- CORS support to enable secure communication with the frontend.

## Tech Stack

- **Python Flask**: Backend framework.
- **Flask-CORS**: To handle Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS).
- **SQLAlchemy** (Optional): For database operations (if needed).
- **Dotenv**: For managing environment variables.
